## NKI-TGO Repository üëã

Within the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AvL), ‚ÄúTranslational Gastrointestinal Oncology TGO Group‚Äù works on the pathology of gastrointestinal tumors and comprises of two research groups: [Gerrit Meijer Group](https://www.nki.nl/research/research-groups/gerrit-meijer/) and [Remond Fijneman Group](https://www.nki.nl/research/research-groups/remond-fijneman/).

The TGO group focuses on translational research in the field of gastrointestinal cancer, including characterizing (pre)-malignant lesions by molecular (i.e., DNA, RNA, protein) profiling using -omics techniques, towards biomarker development for early detection of colorectal cancer, as well as to stratify patient groups and arrive at individually tailored therapies.

This is the official GitHub organization for TGO. In this repository, there are documentation/workflows/scripts/pipelines involving TGO research or data management projects.
